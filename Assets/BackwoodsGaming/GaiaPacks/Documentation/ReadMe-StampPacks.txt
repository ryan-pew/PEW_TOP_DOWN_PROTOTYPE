README - Backwoods Gaming Gaia Terrain Stamp Packs

Backwoods Gaming's terrain stamp packs bring additional stamps into Unity for use with Gaia.  Our
packs are simply add-ons for Gaia.  Gaia is not included and must be purchased separately.

Complete documentation for enabling and using stamps within our stamp packs may be found on our 
website.  Below is a complete set of links, including one to purchase Gaia - if you haven't already.
